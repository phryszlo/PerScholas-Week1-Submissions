ðŸš¨JavaScript Functions Homework [Due Aug.12]ðŸš¨
This lab provides an opportunity to practice defining and coding some real-world functions

Note: Google/StackOverflow is a good friend to have around...

Setup & Instructions:
For the exercises in this lab, create a new JS file in VSCODE -- you can name it "JavaScript_Functions.js".

Requirements:
Define and code the functions below.

Define the functions using the approach as specified (either as a function expression or declaration).

Be sure to number each function with a comment above it.

After each function, call it at least once and console.log the results.

For example, here's the first function, our gift to you:

// 1.
function maxOfTwoNumbers(x, y) {
  if (x >= y) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return y;
  }
}

console.log(maxOfTwoNumbers(3, 9));

// 2.
...
Here are the functions:
 1. Define a function, as a function declaration, maxOfTwoNumbersthat takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. If they are the same, return that number. Use the if-else construct or a ternary expression - the Math.max method is not allowed.

2. Define a function, as a function expression, maxOfThreethat takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Again, the Math.max method is not allowed.

3. Define a function, as a function declaration, isCharAVowelthat takes a character as an argument and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

4. Define a function, as a function expression, sumArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers. For example, sumArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 11.

5. Define a function, as a function declaration, multiplyArraythat takes an array of numbers and returns the product those numbers. For example, multiplyArray([2, 4, 5]);would return 40.

6. Define a function, as a function expression, numArgsthat returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.

7. Define a function, as a function declaration, reverseStringthat takes a string, reverses the characters, and returns it. For example, reverseString('rockstar');would return the string "ratskcor".

8. Define a function, as a function expression, longestStringInArraythat takes an array of strings as an argument and returns the length of the longest string.

9. Define a function, as a function declaration, stringsLongerThanthat takes an array of strings and a number as arguments; and returns an array of the strings that are longer than the number passed in. For example, stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3);would return ["hello", "morning"].
